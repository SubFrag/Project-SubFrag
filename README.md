## Problems
Herein, we aim to articulate the two primary challenges or focus areas prevalent in competitive gaming platforms:

### Problem ONE

Upon analyzing the current Play2Earn gaming landscape, 
we've identified two key issues that we are determined to address. 
The first issue is the limited reach of these games, which predominantly attract a small group 
of players primarily involved in a specific blockchain ecosystem. This restriction hinders the growth and wider acceptance of Play2Earn games in the mainstream gaming community.

The second problem lies in the quality of the gaming experience. Many Play2Earn games grapple with scalability issues and high latency, which diminish the gameplay experience. Scalability problems, which prevent these games from efficiently handling an increase in players or transactions, often result in slow, laggy gameplay. High latency or 'ping' issues contribute to delays between a player's action and the game server's response, disrupting the real-time interaction crucial for an immersive gaming experience.

Our mission is to tackle these challenges head-on, creating a Play2Earn platform that is accessible to a broader audience, and delivers a high-quality, smooth, and responsive gaming experience.


### Problem TWO

In the realm of competitive gaming, countless players around the world harbor aspirations of turning their passion into a professional career. They pour in countless hours, honing their skills and building their teams, all with the dream of reaching the professional echelons.

However, one of the main barriers is the lack of adequate platforms where they can effectively test their abilities and showcase their talent. Opportunities for proving their mettle in a competitive setting, particularly for team-based competition, are scarce.

Additionally, there's a significant gap when it comes to rewards. Despite their dedication and the time they invest, many players find that there's little to no return on their efforts. They're seeking to improve, to compete, and ultimately to earn from their gaming skills, but the current gaming landscape often fails to provide a path for monetary gain or career progression.

Our goal is to address these issues by creating a platform that not only provides the much-needed competitive arena for teams, but also recognizes and rewards players' time and skill investment, providing a real opportunity for players to turn their passion for gaming into a viable career.

## The MVP of the platform

Our platform is designed to be a cutting-edge gaming hub, with our initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focusing on serving the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) community. We've adopted a modular, scalable architecture to ensure our platform can easily evolve and expand to support more games in the future.

The platform's core is a robust server infrastructure, specifically optimized for hosting CS:GO servers. Our servers are designed to deliver low latency and high-performance gameplay, providing an unparalleled CS:GO experience. This ensures that every bullet, every strategy, and every move in your game is as responsive and reliable as possible.

Furthermore, our platform incorporates state-of-the-art matchmaking systems. These algorithms are designed to pair you with players of similar skill level, ensuring balanced and competitive matches.

Our user interface is clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate, which makes the process of finding games, interacting with other players, and accessing platform features smooth and effortless.

On the security front, our platform has been engineered with a strong focus on fairness and player safety. Sophisticated anti-cheat systems work tirelessly to ensure a level playing field, while rigorous community management tools keep toxicity in check.

Finally, we've built in robust analytics capabilities. This means that over time, we'll be able to use data to improve the platform and introduce new features that our users really want.

This MVP is just the beginning. As we grow and learn from our users' feedback, we will continue to refine and expand our platform, with the ultimate aim of providing the best possible gaming experience.
